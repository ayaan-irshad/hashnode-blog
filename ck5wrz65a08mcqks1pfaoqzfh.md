## 100DaysOfCode, Day 5

## 5. A buggy day

## Day 5: January 27, Monday

**Project:** React pics and React Weather

**Progress:** fixed bugs 

**Thoughts:** Added some more functionality and fixed some errors and bugs on the two previously built apps. I think it's very important to review your code refactor it wherever possible.
