## 8. React Weather Update

### Day 8: January 30, Thursday

**Project:** React Weather app

**Progress:** Added error handling

**Thoughts:** I noticed that my React Weather app was crashing when user entered a wrong place name value. Fixed that by creating a error property in the state of the weather card component and toggling that property from componentDidUpdate() lifecycle method and showing the error to the user without breaking the app.
